/**
 * The audio jitter buffer, told what to aim for.
 *
 * The host sends one Opus frame every 5 ms and the browser decodes the track
 * itself — its NetEq buffer is the whole of what stands between the two, and
 * nothing here used to say a word about it. Left alone it sizes itself on the
 * arrival jitter it sees, and the overlay's "Audio buffer" read 129 ms on a
 * LAN with no network jitter to speak of: 200 packets a second leave the host
 * in bursts rather than in a steady stream, and NetEq reads a burst exactly as
 * it reads a congested link.
 *
 * A target puts a stake in the ground. 60 ms is twelve Opus frames — room for
 * a burst of a dozen packets, and still far above the 5 ms frame it plays out.
 * Video's target is set the same way, adaptively, from StreamView's stats loop
 * (WebRtcMedia.setVideoJitterBufferTarget).
 *
 * ⚠️ libwebrtc applies `jitterBufferTarget` as a MINIMUM delay (NetEq's base
 * minimum): it can raise the buffer, never take it below what NetEq wants. So
 * the 60 ms is a floor, and on a clean link where NetEq would settle lower,
 * every sound waits for it. Whether it costs anything is measured before it is
 * changed (plan « le son et la priorité des paquets », A0-A2): the bench key
 * `mw_audio_target` in localStorage sets another floor, or `off` none at all.
 *
 * Chrome 124 and later, Firefox 115 and later and Safari 27 have the property
 * (MDN); a browser without it is a no-op here rather than a fallback.
 *
 * Only the stream's sound: the audio road's tracks (`vaudio`, `uaudio`, POC
 * Ultra U1.4 ter) are audio tracks that carry video, and their receivers are
 * kept at 0 by RtpVideo.
