///
/// ── Scancodes, not virtual keys ─────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// Games read the keyboard through Raw Input or DirectInput, and both of those
/// see SCANCODES. A virtual-key injection is invisible to them: the menu of a
/// game would respond while the game itself would not, which is the confusing
/// half-working failure this avoids. So a press is mapped VK → scancode and
/// injected with KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE.
///
/// The exception is the browser's NON_NORMALIZED flag, which says "this key had
/// no US-layout equivalent, take the code as it is". There, injecting a
/// scancode would resolve through the wrong layout, so the virtual key goes in
/// directly and the host's active layout decides.
///
/// ── Not usable from session 0 ───────────────────────────────────────────────
///
/// SendInput targets the calling thread's desktop. A Windows service in session
/// 0 has no interactive desktop, so injection silently does nothing there. That
/// is a property of the OS, not of this class — the console-session launcher is
/// what solves it, and the probe already refuses a session with no interactive
/// desktop.
