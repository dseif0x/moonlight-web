//  mw-native-host — MoonlightWeb's own capture & encoding engine.
//
//  This is the ENTIRE public surface. Everything else in this tree is an
//  implementation detail, and nothing outside it may include a header from
//  src/.
//
//  Three rules govern this module, and a build-time test enforces the first:
//
//   1. No Qt, no moonlight-common-c, no GPL dependency. Ever. The module has to
//      stay relicensable on its own (see LICENSE.md).
//   2. Detect → Optimize → Stream. The engine works out the display's GPU, the
//      capture API, the encoder, the codec and every encoding parameter by
//      itself. The only decision left to a human is WHICH DISPLAY.
//   3. Latency first. When quality and latency conflict the engine picks
//      latency, and any buffer, queue, copy or thread hop added here has to
//      justify itself.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
