// The audio road's sender (POC Ultra U1.4 ter; plan « Wi-Fi », W4): the
// chunks of the frames sent on an Opus track, handed to libdatachannel at a
// paced rate by a thread of its own, instead of a frame's every chunk back to
// back from the capture thread.
//
// ── Why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The road has neither SCTP's window nor Chrome's congestion control: a HEVC
// keyframe left as ~200 packets in one run. On a Mac in Wi-Fi (05/10/2026,
// 22:40), the kernel dropped 3,833 datagrams a pass for a full socket buffer,
// against 352 for SCTP, and the click went through 23 times out of 60. The
// pacing spreads a frame over a little of its interval; the other half of the
// answer is the rate governor, which hears of the road's resends with SCTP's
// retransmissions (DataChannelRelay, linkstats) and cuts the bitrate on them.
// W2 A is a warning: on SCTP, pacing alone did not lower the Mac's drops.
//
// ── What it gave (06/10/2026, W4 « after », a Mac in Wi-Fi, HEVC) ─────────
//
// Worse, as W2 A had warned: at 3x over the 50 Mbit/s floor, 693 to 5,011
// kernel drops a pass and 31-43 clicks out of 60; a frame in one run with the
// resends feeding the governor, 802-4,266 and 44-53 (before: 2,067-3,833 and
// 17-37). Chrome's socket fills when Chrome reads late. So it is off by
// default, a bench key (aroadpace=); only a rate well under what Chrome reads
// could help, and the governor's cut on the resends is what does.
//
// ── The rate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `multiple` times what the road carried over the last second, never under
// `floorBytesPerSecond`, in bursts of `burstBytes` at most. A resend asked by
// the page goes before what waits: it is the oldest data the page wants.
//
// ── The window (plan « Wi-Fi », W4; bench key aroadwin=) ───────────────────
//
// What SCTP has and the road lacked: an ack clock. The page names the last
// chunk it received (`aroadack`, a few times a frame); the chunks sent up to
// that one have left the network, delivered or lost. At most `windowBytes`
// stay in flight past it: when Chrome reads late, its acks stop and so does
// the host, instead of Chrome's socket overflowing in the kernel (W1 bis: no
// drop under ~48 KB in flight on the Mac). A page that never acks is never
// held, and an ack that stops for kStaleUs opens the window again. A delta
// frame held so long that a newer one waits behind it, none of its chunks
// sent yet, is dropped (the latest frame wins); the page sees the hole and
// asks for a keyframe, as for any frame it gives up on.
