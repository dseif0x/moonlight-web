/**
 * @brief The media engine backed by this machine's own screen.
 *
 * The Qt-side adapter over `backend/native-host/`. It is deliberately thin: the
 * engine below knows nothing of Qt, and everything above it — the three relays,
 * the WSS fallback, the input watchdog — already speaks to IMediaEngine. So all
 * this class does is translate, and it must not accumulate policy of its own.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT do, and why ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * No queue between the engine and the relay. The engine hands over a frame on
 * its capture thread and the relay sends it before returning, which is exactly
 * the arrangement the GameStream path spends a thread hop to approximate. That
 * hop — worker thread → queued Qt signal → relay thread — is one of the costs
 * this whole module exists to remove, so re-adding it here would be self-
 * defeating.
 *
 * ── Metrics ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `hostRttMs()` is 0 and `hostIpTtl()` is 0: there is no host to reach and no
 * datagram to inspect. Reporting a fabricated number would be worse than an
 * absent one, and the stats overlay already handles a zero.
 *
 * `takeHostProcessingLatencyMs()` is the one metric that gets BETTER: on the
 * GameStream path it is whatever the remote host chose to report, while here it
 * is measured — the real present→encoded time of every frame in the window.
 *
 * And it goes further: every frame carries its stamps from the display's
 * present to the encoder's output, and the sender thread reports when the last
 * fragment left (FrameSentSink). Six stages, mean and tail, in the stats
 * message every window and in the log once at the end of the session. Nothing
 * on this path is optimized on a guess.
