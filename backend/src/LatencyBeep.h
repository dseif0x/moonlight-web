/**
 * @brief Click-to-sound probe, host side: the latency flag's beep (plan « le son
 *        et la priorité des paquets », A1).
 *
 * The click-to-photon flag (LatencyFlag.h) times the picture; this times the
 * sound the same way. When the bench asks for it — MW_LATENCY_FLAG_SOUND in the
 * server's environment, never set by the product — the flag also plays a beep:
 * 20 ms of a 1 kHz tone on the default output, the one the stream captures.
 * The client's half (scripts/bench/photon/click-sound.cpp) hears it through its
 * own loopback and times click → sound, click → flag, and the gap between the
 * two, which is the stream's lip-sync offset.
 *
 *   - `click`: a beep with every flag an injected click raises;
 *   - `tick`: no click needed — beep and flag together every 500 ms, for the
 *     offset alone (the client pairs each beep with its flag).
 *
 * The output stream is opened once, when the flag starts, and kept running on
 * silence: opening one per beep would add its own start-up to every figure.
 * Each beep is logged twice on the steady clock the relay stamps with — when
 * it was asked for, and when its first sample went into the output buffer with
 * how much was queued ahead of it — so a pass can split the host's own share
 * (beep → its capture, from `audiolog=1`) from the rest.
 *
 * Windows only; elsewhere every call is inert.
